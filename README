CSE 2421
lab3
Name: Chuhan Feng
Time taken: 6 hr
Problems encountered:
The problem I encountered this time was that I didn't distinguish clearly
the difference between '.' sign and '->' sign when I used struct. I finally
understood that '->' should be used with struct pointer, and '.' should be
used with the struct itself.
